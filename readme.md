# Pneumonia detection system using Tensorflow keras library

<h5>My model is trained to classify chest x-ray images into three categories: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, or Bacterial Pneumonia</h5>
<br>

The file structure for my dataset is

<img src= "filestructure.png" height = '300' width='250'>


### Dataset used :
you can download dataset from here <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia">Kaggle Chest xray pneumonia Dataset</a>

### Model used :
VGG 16 https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/vgg16.html#:~:text=VGG%2D16%20is%20a%20convolutional,%2C%20pencil%2C%20and%20many%20animals

## Result :
Pneumonia chest xrays gets classified into Viral , Bacterial or Normal

when i passed an image that was of Bacterial Pneumonial Category

<img src= "Result3.png" height = '500' width='900'>


when i passed an image that was of normal category

<img src= "Result2.png" height = '450' width='800'>


when i passed an image that was of Viral Pneumonial category

<img src= "Result.png" height = '450' width='800'>



## Libraries used : 
<a href = "https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/train_and_evaluate"> Tensorflow library - Keras </a>


## Kaggle notebook link for the project I made using another way (which classifies as NORMAL or PNEUMONIAL)
